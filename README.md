# hello-gatsby

A little play around at building a site using the base "Hello World" set up in Gatsby. Very interesting stuff! To see the fully rendered site, check out: https://nervous-elion-df0294.netlify.com/

## Some To Do's

This is very much a work-in-progress project designed to be a good starting point for Netlify hosted, CMS driven Gatsby builds. To that end there are still some things I need to do:

* Image optimisation
* Auto generated page/post slugs
* Content search
* Widgetised areas
* Front end Javascript
* Understanding users and logins for non admin's on Netlify
